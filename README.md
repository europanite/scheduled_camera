# [Scheduled Camera](https://github.com/europanite/scheduled_camera "Scheduled Camera")

An automated camera capture system for Linux that periodically takes snapshots from a USB camera using `ffmpeg` or `v4l2`.  

It is designed for **headless servers, IoT devices, and time-lapse photography setups**, requiring no GUI or heavy dependencies.

## 📸 Overview
